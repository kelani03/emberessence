## Description
This is our group project for CIT2011: Web Programming. The website includes user registration and login functionality, product listing, shopping cart, and invoice generation. It uses HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (Vanilla).

## Features
- User registration with input validation (e.g., TRN format, age verification).
- Login with password authentication and account error after 3 failed attempts.


## Login Credentials
Use the following credentials for testing:
- TRN: `155-555-555`
- Password: `abcdefghijk`

## Tools and Frameworks Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout design.
- **JavaScript**: For user interactions and LocalStorage management.

## Instructions for Testing & How to Run 
2. Try registering a new user using the "Sign Up" form. Ensure all fields are filled correctly.
3. Test the login functionality using the sample credentials or the TRN/password of a newly registered user.
4. If the login fails three times, the application redirects to the error page (`error.html`).

## Additional Notes
- The TRN must follow the format `000-000-000`.
- Passwords must be at least 8 characters long.
